                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p id="string-green">"Hey there, I'm Emily. I have always been a bit of a nerd. As a kid I loved making
                    my own math tests
                    to prepare for school. While that isn't something I do anymore, I love reading, video games,
                    gardening,
                    hiking, and playing dungeons and dragons with my friends.
                </p>
                <p id="string-green">
                    It took me a little bit to find my path in life. However, as soon as I started to code I knew I
                    finally found it.
                    It engages my mind, in fact I can loose hours coding. It also empowers me to solve problems while
                    creating new things.
                    At this stage I am still discovering my specific interests in coding, I just want to take it all in
                    and seize any opportunity."

                    <p id="string-green">"This is a personal side projected I started to practice implementing what I
                        was learning at Tech Elevator. This command line program
                        takes user input and generates a backstory using as much or as little as you give it! For more
                        information check out its README."

                    <h4>TEnmo Money Transfer App</h4>
                    <p id="string-green">"This project was one of our capstone group projects at Tech Elevator. We were tasked
                        with building a money transfer application, much like Venmo, that operates from the command line. Our API needed
                        to be RESTful and we wrote the server and client in java, following the MVC design pattern. On the server side we had 
                        DAOs to access the database and create objects with our model classes. Our controller handled incoming requests from 
                        the client and required authentication. Our server made use of the Spring Framework and dependency injection. On the 
                        client side we created a service class that sent requests to our server containing JWTs for authenitcation. Our console
                        service class was responsible for the view and formatted displays for the user."
                    </p>
                    <p id="string-green">"After we completed and handed in the assignement, I decided I wanted to redo it to add in some additional
                        concepts we learned. Our initial project had grouped too many methods into one DAO class that did not relate to the same model or
                        table. So I created more model classes and additional DAOs. This resulted in more organized and understandable structure. 
                        Additionally, I added a service layer that interacted with the DAOs and handled the business logic. This meant the controller only
                        needed to access the service layer to access the necessary information, and if the project grows it will be more easily scaleable.
                        On the client side I removed some of the logic from our console service that felt unrelated to the display. I put that logic in its own
                        class. I also broke up some of the method into smalled reusable methods to the DRY rule. Lastly, my group ran out of time and couldn't
                        implement the optional use cases, so I added functionality for those use cases as well."     
                    </p>
                    <p id="string-green">"I plan to continue working on this project when I can. I suspect the client side can be cleaned up even further. I would also 
                        like to add transactions to the server, add in customer exceptions, and write unit tests for the code."
